# Test a light button button
A light button has a switch and a light
The light can be parmanent ON/OFF or dependant on the button state ON/OFF
The example shows 3 button where light is differently configured.
The first two button are calling the same callback function and the third
Button is calling a different callback version. This should show how to handle
the callback function.
